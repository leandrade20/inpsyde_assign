# inpsyde_project
I have created a custom post-type called Employee and a function also in the function.php, where it creates a loop to display the employees.

I tried to keep it simply using bootstrap, css and jquery.

The  function creates custom fields in the add new employee page such as: Position and 4 social medias. It also check if the social media field is no empty, so It displays a social media icon of the social media only if the field was filled up.

I have created 3 employees as an example, any new employee will display automaticly in the employee page.

The page is live in a temporary server:

jobs-task@inpsyde.com

I am open to clarify anything missing.

I hope it is good enough.

Thank you,
Leandro Andrade
